Scripts for generating data

1. `diabetes_sample_data.csv` created using `generate_diabetes_data.py`

2. `dragon_data.csv` created using `dragon_data.py`

3. `python_basics.py` is a Python script that contains basic Python commands and functions for data analysis, including importing packages, reading data, and plotting.

4. `install_packages.R` is an R script that installs necessary packages for data analysis, including `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`.

5. `generate_USArrestsdata.py` creates a pandas DataFrame containing the USArrests dataset, which includes statistics on violent crime rates

6. `generate_diabetes_data.py` generates a sample diabetes dataset with features like age, BMI, and blood pressure.

7. `dragon_data.py` creates a sample dataset of dragon species with features like length, weight, and fire-breathing ability.

8. `tsne_simple_exercise.py` is a Python script that demonstrates the use of t-SNE for dimensionality reduction on a sample dataset.

9. `pca_animation_advanced.py` is a Python script that performs PCA on a sample dataset and generates an animated plot to visualize the results.

10. `norm.py` is a Python script that demonstrates normalization techniques on a sample dataset (z-score normalization).

11. `simple_pca_plotting.py` is a Python script that performs PCA on a sample dataset and generates a scatter plot of the first two principal components.

12. `pca_plot_simple_withtextlabels.py` is a Python script that performs PCA on a sample dataset and generates a scatter plot of the first two principal components with text labels for each point.

13. `tsne_statquest_inspired.py` is a Python script that demonstrates the use of t-SNE for dimensionality reduction on the digits dataset, inspired by StatQuest's explanation of t-SNE. It includes visualizations of the t-SNE optimization process and the effects of different perplexity values.

14. `*statquest*.py` are files which explain tSNE and are inspired by the videos created by StatQuest. 

15. `sns_clustermap*.py` are Python scripts that demonstrates the use of seaborn's clustermap function to visualize hierarchical clustering on a sample dataset.

16. `missing_data_solutions.py` is a Python script that generates a synthetic dataset with various missing data patterns (MCAR, MAR, MNAR, block missingness) and visualizes the missing data using heatmaps and bar plots.

17. `silhouette.py` is a Python script that demonstrates the calculation and visualization of silhouette scores for clustering results on a sample dataset. It includes functions to compute silhouette scores, plot silhouette diagrams, and interpret the results.
