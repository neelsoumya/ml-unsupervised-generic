Measure compactness vs separation (e.g., silhouette).\n* **External metrics**: require ground truth/labels (experimental groups, annotated cell types). \n<!--Use ARI, NMI, precision/recall on pairwise same/different labels.-->\n* **Biological validation**: compare clusters to known marker genes, pathways, experimental metadata (batch, donor), or enrichment tests. Often the most important for biologists.\n\n---\n\n## Quick metrics cheat-sheet (what they tell you)\n\n* **Explained variance (PCA)** — fraction of variance captured by components (useful for dimensionality reduction decisions).\n* **Silhouette score** (−1..1) — how well each sample fits its cluster vs nearest other cluster; good general-purpose internal metric.\n<!--\n* **Calinski–Harabasz** — ratio of between/within dispersion (higher = better).\n* **Davies–Bouldin** (lower = better) — average similarity between each cluster and its most similar one.\n* **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** — similarity between two labelings corrected for chance (commonly 0..1).\n* **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)** — information overlap between labelings (0..1).\n* **Trustworthiness** (for embeddings like UMAP/t-SNE) — how well local neighborhoods are preserved.\n-->\n* **Stability / reproducibility** — how consistent cluster assignments are under parameter changes.\n\n---\n\n\n## (Optional) Exercise on cancer data\n\n* You have been given some data on cancer cell lines\n\n* Team up with someone and perform hierarchical clustering on this data\n\n* You have been given some starter code to help you load the data\n\n* The data has been downloaded and processed for you (after you run the code below). \n\n* The data is in the variable named `X`\n\n<!-- TODO: find out what are labels -->\n\n<!-- TODO: silhouette plots -->\n\n::: {#22e4b308 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport requests\nfrom sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering\nfrom scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load data\nX = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cambiotraining/ml-unsupervised/refs/heads/main/course_files/data/cancer_data_saved_NC160.csv\", index_col=0)\n\n\nprint(\"Fetching labels from GitHub...\")\nlabs_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsoumya/python_machine_learning/main/data/NCI60labs.csv'\nresponse = requests.get(labs_url)\nresponse.raise_for_status()\n# Read the raw text and split into lines.\nall_lines = response.text.strip().splitlines()\n\n# Skip the first line (the header) to match the data dimensions.\nlabs = all_lines[1:]\n\n# The labels in the file are quoted (e.g., \"CNS\"), so we remove the quotes.\nlabs = [label.strip('\"') for label in labs]\n\n# Your code below ......\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nFetching labels from GitHub...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n* Write your code while working in pairs or a group\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Click to expand\n\n::: {#f8535e5e .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Hierarchical Clustering\nagg = AgglomerativeClustering(linkage='average', metric='manhattan')\ncluster_labels = agg.fit_predict(X)\n\n# Compute linkage matrix for the dendrogram\nZ = linkage(X, method='average', metric='cityblock')\n\n# Plot Dendrogram\nplt.figure()\ndendrogram(Z, labels=labs)\nplt.title('Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram (NCI60, Average Linkage, Manhattan Distance)')\nplt.xlabel('Cell Line')\nplt.ylabel('Distance')\nplt.xticks(rotation=90)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](evaluation_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=705 height=470}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n<!-- end callout -->\n\n\n\n### Exercise: try another linkage method and another distance metric\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Important Concept (recall)\n\n* There is no \"correct\" answer in unsupervised machine learning!\n\n* So how do you know when you are done? \n:::\n<!-- end callout -->\n\n\n## Evaluating the Quality of Clusters\n\nEvaluating the quality of clusters is a crucial step in any unsupervised learning task. Since we do not have a single _correct_ answer, we use several methods that fall into three main categories:\n\n### 1. Internal Evaluation\nMeasures how good the clustering is based only on the data itself (e.g., how dense and well-separated the clusters are).\n\n### 2. External Evaluation\nMeasures how well the clustering results align with known, ground-truth labels. This is possible here because the NCI60 dataset has known cancer cell line types, which we loaded as `labs`.\n\n### 3. Visual Evaluation\nInspecting plots (like the dendrogram or PCA) to see if the groupings seem logical.\n\n---\n\nLet us add the two most common metrics: one internal and one external.\n\n---\n\n### Internal Evaluation: Silhouette Score\n\nThe **Silhouette Score** measures how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation).\n\n- **Score Range**: -1 to +1  \n- **Interpretation**:\n  - **+1**: The sample is far away from the neighboring clusters (very good).\n  - **0**: The sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters.\n  - **-1**: The sample is assigned to the wrong cluster.\n\n---\n\n### External Evaluation: Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)\n\nThe **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** measures the similarity between the true labels (`labs`) and the labels assigned by our clustering algorithm (`cluster_labels`). It accounts for chance groupings.\n\n- **Score Range**: -1 to +1  \n- **Interpretation**:\n  - **+1**: Perfect agreement between true and predicted labels.\n  - **0**: Random labeling (no correlation).\n  - **< 0**: Worse than random labeling.\n\n\n* Here is how you would implement this\n\n::: {#bb42ac50 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom sklearn.metrics import silhouette_samples, silhouette_score, adjusted_rand_score # Import evaluation metrics\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Hierarchical Clustering\nagg = AgglomerativeClustering(linkage='average', metric='manhattan')\ncluster_labels = agg.fit_predict(X)\n\n# 1.

Higher is better\")\n\n# 2. External Evaluation: Adjusted Rand Index\n# Compares our cluster labels to the true cancer type labels.\nari = adjusted_rand_score(labs, cluster_labels)\nprint(\"Adjusted Rand Index\")\nprint(ari)\nprint(\"Compares to true labels.

Higher is better\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Intuition of silhouette score\n\nThink of each data point as asking two questions:\n\n- **How close am I to points in my own cluster?** (call this **a**)  \n- **How close would I be, on average, to the _nearest other_ cluster?** (call this **b**)\n\nThe silhouette value for the point compares those two answers:\n\n- If **a** is much smaller than **b** (you are much closer to your own cluster than to any other), the silhouette is close to **+1** → *great fit*.  \n- If **a ≈ b**, silhouette is near **0** → *on the boundary between clusters*.  \n- If **a > b**, silhouette is **negative** → *probably misassigned* (you are closer to another cluster than your own).\n\nNumerically:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{b - a}{\\max(a, b)}\n\\]\n\nSo\n\n\\[\ns \\in [-1,\\,1]\n\\]\n\n\n\n<!--\n* Silhouette plots\n\nA silhouette plot is a visual diagnostic for clustering quality that (1) computes a silhouette value for each sample and (2) shows the distribution of those values for every cluster. It helps you see which clusters are tight and well-separated and which contain ambiguous or poorly assigned samples.\n\n* Notes on interpreting silhouette plots\n\n- Each horizontal block is a cluster; the width at a given vertical position is the silhouette value of a sample.\n\n- Values close to +1 → sample is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighbors.\n\n- Values near 0 → sample lies between clusters.\n\n- Negative values → sample is likely assigned to the wrong cluster.\n\n- The red dashed line is the average silhouette score; use it as a quick summary, but always inspect per-cluster distributions — a high average can hide poorly-formed small clusters.\n-->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--\n* Notes on interpreting silhouette plots\n\n- Each horizontal block is a cluster; the width at a given vertical position is the silhouette value of a sample.\n\n- Values close to +1 → sample is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighbors.\n\n- Values near 0 → sample lies between clusters.\n\n- Negative values → sample is likely assigned to the wrong cluster.\n\n- The red dashed line is the average silhouette score; use it as a quick summary, but always inspect per-cluster distributions — a high average can hide poorly-formed small clusters.\n-->\n\n* Compare to literature and what others have done\n\n* Plain old visual evaluation\n\n - compare to labels of what these cell lines are (assuming this is available)\n \n<!--TODO: XX what do these labels mean? -->\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--\nThe silhouette value (per sample)\n\nFor sample \n𝑖\ni:\n\n𝑎\n(\n𝑖\n)\na(i) = average distance from \n𝑖\ni to all other points in the same cluster (intra-cluster distance).\n\nFor every other cluster \n𝐶\nC, compute the average distance from \n𝑖\ni to points in \n𝐶\nC; let \n𝑏\n(\n𝑖\n)\nb(i) be the smallest of those (the nearest other cluster's average distance).\n\nThe silhouette value is\n\n𝑠\n(\n𝑖\n)\n=\n𝑏\n(\n𝑖\n)\n−\n𝑎\n(\n𝑖\n)\nmax\n⁡\n(\n𝑎\n(\n𝑖\n)\n,\n \n𝑏\n(\n𝑖\n)\n)\n.\ns(i)=\nmax(a(i),b(i))\nb(i)−a(i)\n\t​\n\n.\n\nRange: \n−\n1\n≤\n𝑠\n(\n𝑖\n)\n≤\n1\n−1≤s(i)≤1.\n\n𝑠\n(\n𝑖\n)\n≈\n1\ns(i)≈1: sample is well matched to its own cluster and far from neighbours.\n\n𝑠\n(\n𝑖\n)\n≈\n0\ns(i)≈0: sample lies between two clusters.\n\n𝑠\n(\n𝑖\n)\n<\n0\ns(i)<0: sample is probably assigned to the wrong cluster (closer on average to another cluster than to its own).\n\nExample: if \n𝑎\n=\n0.3\na=0.3 and \n𝑏\n=\n0.6\nb=0.6, then \n𝑠\n=\n(\n0.6\n−\n0.3\n)\n/\n0.6\n=\n0.5\ns=(0.6−0.3)/0.6=0.5 — a reasonably good assignment.\n\nThe silhouette plot\n\nEach cluster is shown as a horizontal block.\n\nWithin each block, samples are ordered by silhouette value and displayed as horizontal bars (width = \n𝑠\n(\n𝑖\n)\ns(i)).\n\nA dashed vertical line shows the average silhouette score across all samples.\n\nThe plot highlights:\n\nCluster compactness (long bars near +1),\n\nPresence of many low/negative values (bad clusters or misassignments),\n\nRelative sizes of clusters.\n-->\n\nHow to interpret (practical heuristics)\n\n- Mean silhouette ≳ 0.5 → strong structure (good clustering).\n\n- Mean silhouette ≈ 0.25–0.5 → weak to moderate structure; inspect clusters individually.\n\n- Mean silhouette ≲ 0.25 → little structure; clustering may be unreliable.
